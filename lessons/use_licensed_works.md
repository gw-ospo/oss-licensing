# Lesson 1: Using Openly Licensed Works Published by Others

## Open licensing concepts

In the world of research and education, open licensing has become increasingly important for enabling the free exchange of ideas, promoting collaboration, and accelerating scientific progress. _But what do we mean by "open licensing"?_

In essence, open licensing refers to a set of principles and legal frameworks that grant permissions for others to freely access, use, modify, and share creative works or products. This concept applies to various types of outputs, including software, research data, scholarly publications, and educational materials.

Open source software is perhaps the most well-known example of open licensing. [Open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses), such as the MIT, BSD, and Apache licenses, allow users to access the source code of a software program, study how it works, modify it to suit their needs, and redistribute the modified versions.

Similarly, the open data movement advocates for making research data openly available and reusable, often under licenses like the [Open Data Commons licenses](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/) or [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) public domain dedication. This enables other researchers to validate findings, combine datasets, and build upon existing work.

Open content licenses, like the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) suite of licenses, are commonly used for scholarly publications, educational resources, media files, and other creative works. These licenses grant varying levels of permissions for reusing, redistributing, and modifying the licensed content.

The principles of open licensing are deeply rooted in the academic traditions of sharing knowledge, enabling peer review and scrutiny, and fostering collaborative advancement of human understanding. By embracing open licensing, researchers and educators can:

1. Increase the transparency and reproducibility of their work, a cornerstone of the scientific method.
2. Facilitate the dissemination of their findings and educational materials to a wider audience, amplifying their impact.
3. Build upon the work of others, accelerating the pace of discovery and innovation.
4. Collaborate more effectively with colleagues across institutions and disciplines, breaking down silos and fostering interdisciplinary research.

Open licensing is not just a technological or legal construct; it represents a _cultural shift towards openness, collaboration, and the democratization of knowledge_. As we delve deeper into this topic, we will explore the practical aspects of using openly licensed works, as well as the considerations involved in licensing your own research outputs and collaborating with others in open source projects.

```{important} Open licensing
Open licensing gives us _freedom_---contrary to intellectual-property instruments that want to control how creative works are used.

Freedom is power. In this case, the power of open-source software comes not just from being able to read the source code, but from being able to contribute to and build from it. 

For this power to be realized, it's not sufficient to make the source public to read. We must attach a license that allows others to modify and distribute the code.
