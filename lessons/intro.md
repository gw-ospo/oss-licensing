# Introduction

This is a a short course that introduces researchers (doctoral students, postdocs, staff researchers and PIs) to the essentials of open-source software (OSS) licensing for research and educational purposes. The course duration should be about 3 hours when taught live, and we will also produce an online version for self-study. 

The course covers the key topics related to using, licensing, and collaborating with open source software, data, and content in a research and education context. Each section includes relevant subtopics and practical considerations, with a focus on understanding licensing concepts, choosing appropriate licenses, navigating institutional processes, and fostering open source collaboration in research teams.
