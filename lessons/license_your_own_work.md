# Lesson 2: Licensing Your Own Software and Other Works 

````{admonition} Vignette: So Much to Share
:class: tip
Dr. Leonor Cruz, a researcher in computational physics, has been working on a new simulation code for modeling complex fluids. The code builds upon existing open-source libraries and incorporates novel algorithms developed by Dr. Cruz and her colleagues.
As she prepares to publish her research findings, Dr. Cruz decides that she wants to make her code available to the wider scientific community. She believes that sharing her work openly will not only enhance the reproducibility and transparency of her research but also enable other researchers to build upon and extend her work.
She wants to not only allow other researchers to use, modify, and share the code, but also to receive attribution for her work. Additionally, she is aware that some of the libraries her code depends on have specific licensing requirements that need to be considered.

Dr. Cruz is also thinking about how to handle the licensing of the data generated by her simulations. She plans to publish the data alongside her code and wants to ensure that it is licensed in a way that allows for reuse and redistribution.

What's more, Dr. Cruz has written detailed documentation and tutorials to accompany her code, and she wants to make sure that these materials are licensed appropriately as well.
As she grapples with these questions, Dr. Cruz seeks guidance on choosing the right licenses for her research outputs by contacting her institution's Open Source Program Office. She wants to understand the implications of different licensing options and how they align with her goals of enabling collaboration and building upon existing work.

Dr. Cruz is also aware that her institution has specific policies and processes related to intellectual property and technology transfer. She wants to ensure that she is following these policies while navigating the licensing questions.

In the following sections, we will explore key considerations and best practices for licensing research outputs, including code, data, and other content types. We will discuss how to choose appropriate open licenses, work with institutional policies and processes, and effectively communicate and share openly licensed research outputs with the scientific community.

Let's dive into the importance of licensing your own research outputs and how it can benefit you, your collaborators, and the scientific community as a whole.

## Why license your research outputs?

As a researcher, you pour your heart and soul into your work, whether it's writing software, collecting and analyzing datasets, or creating insightful visualizations and content. *So what happens to your research outputs once you've published your findings?*

Licensing your work is an important step in ensuring that your contributions have the greatest possible impact and reach. By choosing the right license, you can control how others use, modify, and share your work, while also receiving proper credit and recognition for your efforts.

Here are some reasons why licensing your research outputs is important.

### Reproducibility, transparency, and scientific norms

In scientific research, reproducibility and transparency are essential. By licensing your code, data, and other materials, you make it possible for other researchers to verify your results, build upon your work, and push your field forward.

Openly licensing your research outputs shows your commitment to these scientific norms and helps to foster a culture of openness and collaboration. It shows that you stand behind your work and are willing to subject it to the scrutiny and feedback of your peers.

```

Moreover, many funding agencies and journals now require or strongly encourage researchers to make their outputs publicly available under open licenses. By proactively licensing your work, you can stay ahead of these requirements and demonstrate your dedication to open and transparent research practices.

### Collaboration and building on existing work

One of the most powerful aspects of openly licensing your research outputs is that it facilitates (and even invites) others to collaborate with you and build upon your work. By pre-emptively granting permissions for others to use, modify, and share your code, data, and materials, you open up new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.

Imagine a scenario where another researcher comes across your openly licensed software and realizes that it could be adapted to solve a problem they've been working on. By building upon your work, they are able to make new discoveries and advance their own research. In turn, they may contribute back to your project, leading to a virtuous cycle of collaboration and mutual benefit.

Or perhaps a teacher discovers your openly licensed dataset and incorporates it into a lesson plan, exposing a new generation of students to your work and inspiring them to pursue careers in your field.

By licensing your research outputs, you create a ripple effect of impact that extends far beyond your own lab or institution. You enable others to stand on your shoulders and push the boundaries of what's possible.

### Maximizing your impact and future opportunities

As you progress in your career, the impact and reach of your work compounds over time. Licensing your research outputs is one strategy for maximizing your impact and opening up new opportunities for collaboration, funding, and recognition.
You can establish yourself as a leader in open and reproducible research, and thus attract top collaborators, secure funding from agencies that prioritize openness, and build a reputation as an innovator in your field.

In fact, the skills and knowledge you gain by navigating the licensing process will serve you well throughout your career. You'll be equipped to understand and manage intellectual property, work effectively with technology transfer offices, and make informed decisions about how to share and promote your work.

So, as we move forward in this section, keep in mind the many benefits of licensing your research outputs. By taking control of how your work is used and shared, you can amplify your impact, accelerate discovery, and unlock new opportunities for your career and your field.

## Licensing code, data, and other content types

As a researcher, you produce a wide variety of outputs, each with its own unique characteristics and licensing considerations. In this section, we'll break down some factors to keep in mind when licensing software, data, and other content types.

### Considerations for licensing software
````{margin}
```{danger} You should *not* modify the text of a standard license in any way.
````

When it comes to licensing software, it's essential to use *standard*, widely-recognized licenses that have been vetted by the open-source community. The **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** maintains a list of [approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) that are well-understood and legally sound.

[Choose a license](http://choosealicense.com) that aligns with your values and goals. For academic and research software, we *strongly recommend using permissive open-source licenses* like the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), [BSD-3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/), or [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) licenses. These licenses place minimal restrictions on how others can use, modify, and distribute your code, while still ensuring that you receive proper credit and attribution.

```{note}
Permissive licenses are particularly well-suited for academic settings, as they allow for the greatest flexibility and potential for collaboration and reuse. They also reduce barriers to adoption and make it easier for others to integrate your code into their own projects, even if they are using different licenses.
```

When choosing a license for your software, be sure to consider any dependencies or third-party libraries that you are using, as their licenses may impact your choice. Whenever possible, aim for license compatibility to avoid legal conflicts and make it easier for others to use and build upon your work.

### Licensing options for research data

Data licensing is a complex and evolving area, but keep in mind some key principles. As a general rule, *aim to make your data as open and accessible as possible, while still respecting any privacy, security, or ethical concerns.*

For most research data, we recommend using a permissive license like the [Creative Commons CC0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/) public-domain dedication or the [CC-BY license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/). These options allow others to freely use, share, and adapt your data, while still giving you credit as the original creator.

In some cases, you may need to use a more restrictive license or distribution method to protect sensitive or confidential data. However, whenever possible, try to provide at least a subset or aggregated version of your data under an open license to support reproducibility and reuse.

When licensing your data, be sure to clearly document any terms of use, attribution requirements, or other conditions. This will help others understand how they can responsibly use and share your data.

### Creative Commons licenses for text, media, and other content

For non-software outputs like text, images, videos, and other creative works, the Creative Commons (CC) licenses are the gold standard. These licenses provide a simple, standardized way to grant permissions and specify attribution requirements for your work.

The [CC-BY license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/) is the most permissive option, allowing others to freely use, share, and adapt your work as long as they give you credit. The [CC-BY-SA](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/) license adds a "share-alike" requirement, meaning that any adaptations must be shared under the same license terms. The CC-BY-ND license prohibits derivative works, while the CC-BY-NC license restricts commercial use.

When choosing a CC license, consider your goals and the potential impact you want your work to have. In general, we recommend using the most permissive license that still aligns with your needs and values.

```{warning} 
It's important to note that *CC licenses are not appropriate for software*, as they do not address key issues like source code distribution, patent rights, and warranty disclaimers. Stick to OSI-approved licenses for software, and use CC licenses for other types of content.
```

## Empowering others to build upon your work

````{margin}
```{admonition} How to choose?
For academic work: simple and permissive is best. For example, you could use BSD-3 for code, CC0 or CC-BY for data, and CC-BY for other materials.
```
````
By licensing your code, data, and other research outputs under permissive open licenses, you empower others to build upon your work and make new discoveries. You create a foundation of openness and collaboration that can accelerate progress and drive innovation in your field.

As you make decisions about licensing, always keep in mind the bigger picture of how your work can benefit the wider scientific community. By choosing licenses that maximize access and reuse, you can amplify your impact and contribute to a more open and equitable future for research.

### Commercial uses and copyleft licenses

All open-source licenses, by definition, *allow for commercial uses* of the licensed software. This is explicitly stated in point 6 of the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated), which requires that an open-source license "must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor," including commercial endeavors.

However, some businesses perceive copyleft licenses (like the GNU GPL) as less friendly to commercial interests. This is because copyleft licenses require any derivative works or modifications to be released under the same license terms. For companies that want to create proprietary software based on open-source components, this "share-alike" requirement can be seen as a barrier.
In contrast, permissive licenses (like MIT or Apache 2.0) do not have this share-alike requirement, making them more appealing for businesses that want to use open source software in proprietary products.

It's important to note that this perception of copyleft licenses as "business-unfriendly" is not universally shared, and many successful commercial projects do use and contribute to copyleft-licensed software. Nonetheless, it's a factor to consider when choosing a license for your own projects, especially if you aim to encourage commercial adoption and collaboration.

### What about a non-commercial CC license?

When it comes to other types of content, such as text, images, or educational materials, some creators may be tempted to use licenses that restrict commercial use, like the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC license. However, we strongly advise against using non-commercial clauses in licenses for scholarly works, as they can be problematic.

The main issue with non-commercial licenses is that the term "commercial" is not clearly defined and can be interpreted in many different ways. This ambiguity can lead to confusion and uncertainty about how the licensed work can be used, which undermines the very purpose of licensing your works.

For example, consider a faculty member who uses CC-BY-NC licensed material in their teaching and research. If this faculty member also engages in consulting work, would using the material be considered a commercial use? Or imagine a student who uses CC-BY-NC licensed content in their coursework and later develops a business idea inspired by what they learned. Would this constitute a violation of the non-commercial clause?

These scenarios illustrate how difficult it is to draw clear lines between commercial and non-commercial uses in academic settings. Researchers, educators, and students often engage in a mix of activities that blur the boundaries between academia and industry, making it impractical to enforce strict non-commercial provisions.
Moreover, non-commercial clauses can have unintended consequences for the dissemination and impact of scholarly works. They can discourage the use and adaptation of licensed materials in contexts that may not be strictly academic but still serve important educational or research purposes. This can limit the reach and influence of the work and hinder collaboration and innovation.

```{sidebar}
**While it may be tempting to try to restrict commercial uses of your work, in practice, such restrictions often create more barriers than benefits for the academic community.**
```

Instead of using non-commercial licenses, we recommend using more permissive licenses like CC-BY or CC-BY-SA for scholarly content. These licenses allow for a wider range of uses while still ensuring that creators receive proper attribution and credit for their work. They also provide greater clarity and certainty for users, making it easier for others to build upon and share the licensed material.
