# Lesson 2: Licensing Your Own Software and Other Works 

````{admonition} Vignette: So Much to Share
:class: tip
Dr. Leonor Cruz, a researcher in computational physics, has been working on a new simulation code for modeling complex fluids. The code builds upon existing open-source libraries and incorporates novel algorithms developed by Dr. Cruz and her colleagues.
As she prepares to publish her research findings, Dr. Cruz decides that she wants to make her code available to the wider scientific community. She believes that sharing her work openly will not only enhance the reproducibility and transparency of her research but also enable other researchers to build upon and extend her work.
She wants to not only allow other researchers to use, modify, and share the code, but also to receive attribution for her work. Additionally, she is aware that some of the libraries her code depends on have specific licensing requirements that need to be considered.

Dr. Cruz is also thinking about how to handle the licensing of the data generated by her simulations. She plans to publish the data alongside her code and wants to ensure that it is licensed in a way that allows for reuse and redistribution.

What's more, Dr. Cruz has written detailed documentation and tutorials to accompany her code, and she wants to make sure that these materials are licensed appropriately as well.
As she grapples with these questions, Dr. Cruz seeks guidance on choosing the right licenses for her research outputs by contacting her institution's Open Source Program Office. She wants to understand the implications of different licensing options and how they align with her goals of enabling collaboration and building upon existing work.

Dr. Cruz is also aware that her institution has specific policies and processes related to intellectual property and technology transfer. She wants to ensure that she is following these policies while navigating the licensing questions.

In the following sections, we will explore key considerations and best practices for licensing research outputs, including code, data, and other content types. We will discuss how to choose appropriate open licenses, work with institutional policies and processes, and effectively communicate and share openly licensed research outputs with the scientific community.
