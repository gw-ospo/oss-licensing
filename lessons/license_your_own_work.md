# Lesson 2: Licensing Your Own Software and Other Works 

````{admonition} Vignette: So Much to Share
:class: tip
Dr. Leonor Cruz, a researcher in computational physics, has been working on a new simulation code for modeling complex fluids. The code builds upon existing open-source libraries and incorporates novel algorithms developed by Dr. Cruz and her colleagues.
As she prepares to publish her research findings, Dr. Cruz decides that she wants to make her code available to the wider scientific community. She believes that sharing her work openly will not only enhance the reproducibility and transparency of her research but also enable other researchers to build upon and extend her work.
She wants to not only allow other researchers to use, modify, and share the code, but also to receive attribution for her work. Additionally, she is aware that some of the libraries her code depends on have specific licensing requirements that need to be considered.

Dr. Cruz is also thinking about how to handle the licensing of the data generated by her simulations. She plans to publish the data alongside her code and wants to ensure that it is licensed in a way that allows for reuse and redistribution.

What's more, Dr. Cruz has written detailed documentation and tutorials to accompany her code, and she wants to make sure that these materials are licensed appropriately as well.
As she grapples with these questions, Dr. Cruz seeks guidance on choosing the right licenses for her research outputs by contacting her institution's Open Source Program Office. She wants to understand the implications of different licensing options and how they align with her goals of enabling collaboration and building upon existing work.

Dr. Cruz is also aware that her institution has specific policies and processes related to intellectual property and technology transfer. She wants to ensure that she is following these policies while navigating the licensing questions.

In the following sections, we will explore key considerations and best practices for licensing research outputs, including code, data, and other content types. We will discuss how to choose appropriate open licenses, work with institutional policies and processes, and effectively communicate and share openly licensed research outputs with the scientific community.

Let's dive into the importance of licensing your own research outputs and how it can benefit you, your collaborators, and the scientific community as a whole.

## Why license your research outputs?

As a researcher, you pour your heart and soul into your work, whether it's writing software, collecting and analyzing datasets, or creating insightful visualizations and content. So what happens to your research outputs once you've published your findings?

Licensing your work is an important step in ensuring that your contributions have the greatest possible impact and reach. By choosing the right license, you can control how others use, modify, and share your work, while also receiving proper credit and recognition for your efforts.

Here are some reasons why licensing your research outputs is important.

### Reproducibility, transparency, and scientific norms

In scientific research, reproducibility and transparency are essential. By licensing your code, data, and other materials, you make it possible for other researchers to verify your results, build upon your work, and push your field forward.

Openly licensing your research outputs shows your commitment to these scientific norms and helps to foster a culture of openness and collaboration. It shows that you stand behind your work and are willing to subject it to the scrutiny and feedback of your peers.

Moreover, many funding agencies and journals now require or strongly encourage researchers to make their outputs publicly available under open licenses. By proactively licensing your work, you can stay ahead of these requirements and demonstrate your dedication to open and transparent research practices.

### Collaboration and building on existing work

One of the most powerful aspects of openly licensing your research outputs is that it facilitates (and even invites) others to collaborate with you and build upon your work. By pre-emptively granting permissions for others to use, modify, and share your code, data, and materials, you open up new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.

Imagine a scenario where another researcher comes across your openly licensed software and realizes that it could be adapted to solve a problem they've been working on. By building upon your work, they are able to make new discoveries and advance their own research. In turn, they may contribute back to your project, leading to a virtuous cycle of collaboration and mutual benefit.

Or perhaps a teacher discovers your openly licensed dataset and incorporates it into a lesson plan, exposing a new generation of students to your work and inspiring them to pursue careers in your field.

By licensing your research outputs, you create a ripple effect of impact that extends far beyond your own lab or institution. You enable others to stand on your shoulders and push the boundaries of what's possible.

### Maximizing your impact and future opportunities

As you progress in your career, the impact and reach of your work compounds over time. Licensing your research outputs is one strategy for maximizing your impact and opening up new opportunities for collaboration, funding, and recognition.
You can establish yourself as a leader in open and reproducible research, and thus attract top collaborators, secure funding from agencies that prioritize openness, and build a reputation as an innovator in your field.

In fact, the skills and knowledge you gain by navigating the licensing process will serve you well throughout your career. You'll be equipped to understand and manage intellectual property, work effectively with technology transfer offices, and make informed decisions about how to share and promote your work.

So, as we move forward in this section, keep in mind the many benefits of licensing your research outputs. By taking control of how your work is used and shared, you can amplify your impact, accelerate discovery, and unlock new opportunities for your career and your field.
